# Things coded on the [clumsycomputer stream](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer)

[clumsycomputer](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer) is a Twitch stream where we program something
from scratch together to better learn how things work! This usually means no libraries
and potentially no imports. This repository contains the code for
all the things that we coded on stream.

If you find it interesting, please stop by the stream, we'd love to have you around! There's
currently no schedule, so you can follow [twitch.tv/clumsycomputer](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer)
and you'll be notified when it's live!
